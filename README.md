# Stickerify

Online converter that transforms images into static Telegram-compatible stickers and emojis.

## What it does

Stickerify converts your images so they meet Telegram’s static sticker and emoji [requirements](https://core.telegram.org/stickers#static-stickers-and-emoji):

> - For stickers, one side must be exactly 512 pixels in size – the other side can be 512 pixels or less.
> - For emoji, images must be exactly 100x100 pixels in size.
> - The image file must be in either .PNG or .WEBP format.

It allows you to:

- Choose output type: sticker or emoji.
- Scale down large images.
- Scale up small images.
- Trim empty spaces.
- Align images horizontally and vertically.
- Upload and convert up to 25 images at a time.
- Download result as .WEBP file.
- Download multiple results as ZIP file.

Additionally, it has a preview tool that allows you to see how the final result will look for selected options and image size.
